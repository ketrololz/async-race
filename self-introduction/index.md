Hello, world! My name is Bogdan and I\`m a professional front-end
developer… In the future…, but now I\`m in the final week of the 1st Stage at
Rolling Scopes School. If you want to know about how I got here, have a seat,
I\`ll tell you about it!  

I never thought I would be here because my life wasn\`t connected to
coding. When I was eleven-twelve years old, I got interested in computer
graphics: I edited photos, drew pictures, made videos, and tried 3D. At
eighteen, I decided I wanted to do creative work and started learning how to
make graphics for mobile and computer games.  

My brother is a developer, and we made small games together — he wrote
the code, and I created the visuals. He often told me to try programming,
but I thought I couldn’t do it. For about a year and a half, I combined design
with a job in commerce, but after Covid, I needed a remote job. So I started
working as a commercial designer, creating logos, branding, and web
design. In five years, I became successful and was even nominated for
design awards. But I felt like this was not my choice — it just happened.  

In winter 2024, I tried programming for the first time. I started with Unity and
C#, made a simple platformer game, but quickly realized that Unity
development wasn\`t for me. However, this experience showed me that
coding isn\`t as scary as I thought. I started looking for a new direction —
animation, character design, deepening of web design.  

Then, a friend started learning Python, and I remembered my C#
experience. I decided to try web development. In May 2024, I started
learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, then took a short JavaScript
course at Hexlet. I planned to continue there, but my girlfriend found Rolling
Scopes School. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be too hard, but
I still signed up for Zero Stage to try.  

And now, I\`m in the final week of Stage 1, recording this video, and I have no
plans to stop!
